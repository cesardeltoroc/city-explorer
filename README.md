## Overview
This is a front end and back end application that allows users to search for locations they would like to travel to and get information

## Getting Started
The start of this application was using an API to create a map and get the Lat and Lon of a location. Now on Lab 07 I have implemented a server back-end and used a hard coded API. 
## Architecture
This application is using express.js, react.js, html, css, and javascript. Also some bootstrap componenets.

## Change Log
